<?php
// The code below shows an older style of defining a constructor in PHP. Before PHP 5, constructors were defined by creating a method with the same name as the class. In this case, a function named User inside a class named User would act as the constructor for the class.
  class User
  {
    function User($param1, $param2)
    {
      // Constructor statements go here
    }
  }
?>
