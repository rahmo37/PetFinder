<?php
// The __destruct() function in PHP is a special method called a destructor. It is automatically invoked when an object is no longer needed or when the script execution is about to end. Destructors are used to perform any cleanup before the object is destroyed, such as closing files, releasing resources, or other cleanup tasks. This helps in managing resources efficiently and ensuring that the system frees up resources that are no longer in use.
  class User
  {
    function __destruct()
    {
      // Destructor code goes here
    }
  }
?>
