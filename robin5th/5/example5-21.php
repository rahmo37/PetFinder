<?php
// In PHP, self:: is used to access static properties, constants, and methods from within the context of a class. It allows you to refer to the current class itself, rather than an instance of the class. Here's a quick overview of how it's used:

// Static properties: To access a static property within a class method, you use self:: followed by the property name (with a $ sign).
// Constants: To access a constant within a class, you use self:: followed by the constant name (without a $ sign).
// Static methods: To call a static method within another method of the same class, you use self:: followed by the method name.
// self:: is particularly useful when you're working within class methods and need to refer to static elements or constants of the class. It ensures that you're referencing the class itself, not an object instance, maintaining a clear distinction between static and instance contexts.
